When a mission is available for you to start, youâ€™ll see a mission blip on your map and radar. The initials marked within the blip will be linked to the person you need to see. Make your way to the place marked and talk to that person to begin the mission.

After succesfully completing a mission, you will receive a Gold, Silver or Bronze Medal. To check your medals or replay any missions, navigate to the progress section in the Pause menu, then Story. The Chapters panel will show all the story chapters you have completed and the option to replay the mission.
